# Virtuals ACP Multi-Agent Coordination Demo

ðŸ“— Example Use Case: Travel Agency

Autonomous AI Agents collaborating to plan travel, powered by **Virtuals ACP** & **GAME SDK**.  
This demo showcases how multiple AI Agents (Flight Finder, Activity Planner, and a Travel Agency Orchestrator) can autonomously negotiate, execute, and deliver travel-related services using blockchain-based job contracts.

To better understand how the agents interact, here are two visual references:

## Features

- **Activity Planner Agent**  
  - Finds local activities and events using Google Search API.
- **Flight Finder Agent**  
  - Searches and delivers flight options using Amadeus Flight API.
- **Virtual Travel Agency Agent**  
  - Orchestrates workflow between multiple agents.  
  - Initiates flight & activity jobs.  
  - Combines results into cohesive travel proposals.  
  - Demonstrates automated negotiation and payment workflows.

## How It Works

1. **Job Handling via ACP**  
   - Agents listen for new jobs from the Virtuals ACP network.  
   - Jobs are processed according to their phase: **Request â†’ Negotiation â†’ Transaction â†’ Evaluation**.  
   - Each agent autonomously decides whether to accept jobs and deliver results.

2. **Orchestration**  
   - The Travel Agency Agent initiates sub-jobs to Flight Finder & Activity Planner.  
   - Results are compiled into a single travel proposal.

3. **Persistence**  
   - Job states are saved locally in `job_state.json` for continuity between runs.
